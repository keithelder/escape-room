## 🎯 **Objective**

Your mission is simple: **Escape the room by completing coding challenges as fast as possible!** 🕒

Teams of up to 4 developers will face a series of carefully crafted puzzles designed to test your debugging, problem-solving, and data parsing skills. The only way out is to **code your way to freedom!**

## 🏆 **The Challenges**

Each challenge is crafted to be achievable but demands **speed, precision, and teamwork**:

1. **Parse & Analyze Data**: Dig into CSV files to extract, analyze, and calculate values with lightning speed! ⏱️
2. **Debug & Solve**: Tackle real-world bugs and algorithm problems that require quick thinking and an eye for detail. 🔎
3. **Decode the Final Message**: Unravel a mystery message as your final key to freedom! 🔐

💡 **Hint**: This is a race against the clock, so bring your A-game! 🚀

## 🕹️ **How It Works**

1. **Gather Your Team** 🤝: Form a team of up to 4 members, and prepare for the ultimate coding race.
2. **Start the Clock** ⏳: When you enter the virtual escape room, the timer starts, and every second counts.
3. **Solve the Challenges** 💻: Work through each coding task using **any tools, IDEs, libraries, or AI** you want. This is all about speed!
4. **Escape with the Fastest Time** 🏁: Submit your solutions and stop the clock. The fastest team wins and claims **ultimate bragging rights** (and maybe a prize 🥇).
