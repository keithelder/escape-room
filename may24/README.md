# Escape Room May

## Description

Escape Room is a game where up to 4 team members are locked in an area. The only way to "escape" is to code their way out.

## The Challenges

### Challenge 1:

The first challenge is a debug problem. The team will work together to debug a piece of code.

### Challenge 2:

The second challenge is an algorithm problem where the team will channel their inner computer scientist to solve a problem.

### Challenge 3:

The third and final challenge is a decoding problem. The team will have to decode a message to escape.

## How to Play

1. Gather a team of up to 4 people.
1. Disable Github CoPilot if you have it enabled. CoPilot is not allowed in this escape room. All AI hints must be disabled.
1. Once you enter the escape room, share your screen with the coordinator and a compressed file will be shared. Unzip it.
1. Sample files are done in C# and Python. Participants can choose their preferred language.
1. Once the file is unzipped, the coordinator will start the timer.
1. Open the `README.md` file. Read the challenges and instructions.
1. Open the `challenge1` folder of your preferred language in your favorite code editor and begin.
1. Read the challenge comments and follow instructions.
1. Solve all three challenges.
1. If you get stuck you can ask for a "hint" from the coordinator to assist you with your escape. Remember, each hint will add 20 seconds to your escape time. You can ask for as many hints as you need.
1. Once you've solved the first two challenges, you'll be given a final message to decode. DO NOT EVER STATE THE DECODED MESSAGE OUTLOUD VERBALLY.
1. Type decoded message in the chat to the coordinator to escape the room and stop the timer.
1. If you've successfully decoded the message, you've escaped the room! Congratulations!
1. If time has run out, you must stop coding, the coordinator will open the room.
