# Rocket Exchange Escape Room

## Description

Rocket Exchange Escape Room is a high-speed coding challenge where up to 3-5 (four is preferred) team members work together to "escape" by completing specific data-related tasks. _Speed is the name of the game_â€”the fastest team wins!

## The Challenge

### Challenge: CSV Data Processing

Your task is to open a CSV file, parse the data, and complete the following objectives:

1. Calculate and print the *average* loan amount for loans with a status of "Pending."
2. Calculate and print the *average* credit score for loans with a status of "Pending."
3. Retrieve and print the *address* of the loan number: LN00084.

This challenge is all about how fast you can write code to retrieve and process the necessary data. Use any tools, libraries, or programming techniques at your disposal to complete it as quickly as possible!

## How to Play

1. Gather a team of up to 4 people.
2. When you enter the escape room, share your screen with the coordinator, and a compressed file containing the CSV file and instructions will be shared. Unzip it.
3. Once the file is unzipped, the coordinator will start the timer.
4. Open the CSV file and carefully follow the instructions to complete the three tasks listed in the challenge.
5. Use **any tools, IDEs, libraries, or AI** you wishâ€”anything goes as long as it helps you retrieve the data _fast_.
6. If you get stuck, you can ask for a "hint" from the coordinator. Note that each hint will add 20 seconds to your escape time, so use them wisely.
7. Once you've completed all tasks, notify the coordinator to stop the timer and record your time.
8. The **fastest team wins the competition and will be awarded a free lunch**â€”so make every second count!
9. If time runs out, you must stop coding, and the coordinator will open the room.
